          <p class="intro-text">
        Welcome to a new social network where people can share their personal experiences with health issues, connect with experts, and consult with others going through similar situations. Unlike other platforms where medical information can be overwhelming or even scary, our platform focuses on the human side of health and how to deal with it positively.

          </p>
          <p class="journey">
            We understand that everyone's health journey is unique, so we encourage people to share their experiences and insights with others. By connecting with people who have been through similar situations, you can gain new perspectives and insights that you may not have found elsewhere.
          </p>
